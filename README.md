# Emotion-Classifier
Identify input sentence's tone and emotion

Usage : Run the Notebook file. A csv file with the sentences has to be added to the code for training. The resulting models are stored in weights and biases website and will need an account there.

This project was an attempt to familiarise myself with word data and with LSTM networks. The notebook was used in Colab for training due to a lack of compatible GPU in my system and so the code is monolithic for ease of use.
